        <h2 style="font-size: 24px;"><I>Research Background</I></h2>
          <h3 style="font-soze: 20px">According to Shin et al. (2022), the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the number of individuals with dementia worldwide is approximately 55 million, with this number expected to reach approximately 78 million by 2030 and 139 million by 2050.</h3>
          <h3 style="font-soze: 20px">WHO illustrated that dementia is a term for several diseases that affect memory, thinking, and the ability to perform daily activities. Alzheimer disease is the most common form and may contribute to 60–70% of cases in 2023.</h3> 
          <h3 style="font-soze: 20px">Jiménez et al. (2022) indicated information technology can help improve the life quality of people with dementia and reduce the burden on caregivers by making dementia challenges less severe. There is an increasing demand to support informal caregivers and improve their well-being.</h3>
        <h2 style="font-size: 24px;"><I>Research Motivation</I></h2>
          <h3 style="font-soze: 20px">For those who are unable to live independently, informal carers provide ongoing, unpaid assistance. Giving care can be a very demanding responsibility that has a significant negative influence on the mental health of caregivers who are not professionals.</h3>
          <h3 style="font-soze: 20px">The diagnosis is merely the first step in the road; post-diagnostic support can be a difficult field to navigate.     </h3>
          <h3 style="font-soze: 20px">Online communication tools could be a useful intervention approach to educate caregivers of the significance of sharing flexible strategies for coping, which can  reduce their stress and enable them to keep taking care of people they love. </h3>
